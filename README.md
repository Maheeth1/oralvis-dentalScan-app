# OralVis Healthcare ü¶∑

OralVis Healthcare is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline the workflow between dental technicians and dentists. The platform provides a secure, role-based system where Technicians can upload patient dental scans, and Dentists can view, manage, and generate reports for these scans.

This project demonstrates key full-stack development concepts including secure authentication with `HttpOnly` cookies, cloud media management, role-based access control, and a modern, responsive user interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Secure Role-Based Authentication**: Distinct login and dashboard experiences for **Technicians** and **Dentists**. The system utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) stored in secure `HttpOnly` cookies for enhanced security.
-   **"Smart" Sidebar Navigation**: The UI is context-aware, showing only the relevant navigation links based on the logged-in user's role.
-   **Technician Scan Upload**: An intuitive, modern form for uploading patient scan images (JPG/PNG) with associated data (patient name, ID, region).
-   **Cloud Image Storage**: All images are seamlessly and securely uploaded to **Cloudinary**, not stored on the server.
-   **Dentist Scan Viewer**: A dynamic, animated dashboard for viewing all patient scans. Each scan card displays patient info, scan details, an image thumbnail, and the upload date.
-   **PDF Report Generation**: On-the-fly generation of downloadable PDF reports for each scan, containing all relevant patient/scan details and the embedded scan image.
-   **Modern & Responsive UI**: A professional and clean user interface built with **Tailwind CSS**, animated with **Framer Motion**, and featuring **Heroicons** for a premium feel.
